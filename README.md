This is a repo for *Git It: Intro to Git and Github* an
introductory-level workshop for graduate students on Git and Github, originally created
by Nicole Cote as a Graduate Center Digital Initiatives Fall 2022
workshop. It was most recently run during the 2024 MA/MS

## Workshop Details

### Overview
Git and GitHub are powerful tools for collaborative and individual projects. Git is a version control software that aids with tracking changes made to a set of files over time. GitHub is a web-based platform for storing, sharing, and collaborating on project files online. This session begins with a conceptual overview of both tools, including an introduction to fundamental concepts such as version control and practical applications for students and scholars, followed by an applied introduction to getting started with these tools. This workshop is designed for total beginners and is suitable for researchers in any discipline. Prior knowledge of GitHub/programming is not required. 

Note: If you would like to follow along with the applied part of the workshop, before attending you are encouraged to:
